  <h1>Socrates Process</h1>

  The Socrates Process is the overall process of handling one questionnaire.
  This includes the questionnaires pre- and postprocessing, and obviously,
  the processing of the questionnaire's items. Processing a complete questionnaire
  is based on a workflow. The Runner therefore extends the Processor interface.
