  <h1>Socrates Workflow</h1>

  Socrates uses a workflow processor to be able to implement a full
  trajectory of pre- and postprocessing steps for a given
  questionnaire. This could for example include logging in before
  filling in a questionnaire, and by the end of the questionnaire
  filling in some other data, and sending some data off to an SMTP
  server.

  The process is roughly comparable to a FSA: the set of states is the
  set of actions that can be performed, transitions are over the
  result of an action perfomered. The alfabet for the workflow is
  usually just 'ok' and 'fail'. Initial state is the first action to
  be performed, and final states are those where no action is left,
  given a specific mapping.

  <h2>Processing steps</h2>

  The Workflow is build up from processing steps. These steps have
  been named 'Actions'. Every action yields a result that can be used
  to determine the next action to take, or the transition to the next
  action.

  The questionnaire or Model itself is also part of the
  workflow. In general for running a questionnaire, one would need at least
  the steps: Render, Validate and Next. Render
  basically renders whatever there is to be rendered to some
  outputstream, Validate is used to validate incoming data against the
  Model, and finally, Next determines change of state accordingly. If
  Validate fails, the Next action is skipped, so that Render is called
  again with the same item.

  <h2>Process denifition</h2>

  The process is defined in an XML file. This file describes the
  actions, and provides mappings from one action to another, given a
  specific result of the previous action.

  <h2>Implementation</h2>
  This specific implementation API uses the Commons Digester for
  creating a workflow.
