	All restrictions on data, defined in the Model, are in terms of expressions.
	This API defines the core concepts for an expression implementation.
	An expression is defined along the lines:
	
	<code>
	Expression := Expression Operation Expression | Expression UnaryOperation
	Expression := XObject
	</code>

	Untill now we haven't felt the need to implement ternary operators.
