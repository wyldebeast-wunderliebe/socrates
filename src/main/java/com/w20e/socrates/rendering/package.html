    <h1>Socrates Rendering</h1>

	The rendering API defines the core concepts in the layout and visible
	(audible?) structure of a questionnaire, as well as the components used to
	expose the questionnaire to the end user. In general, a questionnaire will 
	be presented in a visual way, but the rendering API doesn't only support
	that use.
	
	Rendering is defined in terms of a RenderConfig object, that can hold Control
	objects, arbitrarily nested within Group objects. A Control is bound to one or
	more Node objects from an Instance by it's bind expression. The Control is
	responsible for processing user input into the underlying data. For instance,
	a date widget can convert a user input string into a date object: the Control
	is the only part that can actually know how it's data is represented for user input 
	and  how the given data should be processed.
