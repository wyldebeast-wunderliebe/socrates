  <h1>Socrates Submission</h1>

  Submission is the process of handling, or rather storing instance data. In
  the XForms terminology
  submission means sending the data off to some handler, be it a file, or http
  call. In the Socrates terminology, submission is also handled by a protocol
  specific handler, but since the instance data remains (largely) on the server
  side, there is no need to send off data over a web protocol particularly.

  Submission should in general only be performed when it is assured that all
  data is valid. This is handled by the model; whenever the last question is
  answered, it may be safely assumed that all data is valid as far as the model
  is concerned.

  Submission handlers are registered with the HandlerManager: this manager
  determines what handler to use, when a specific protocol is needed for
  submission.
