    <h1>Formatter</h1>

	The Fomatter API defines the final stage in representing a questionnaire
	to an end user. The formatter creates the stuff that can be sent over
	a medium, to the end user's means of presenting the content.
 
 	Note that the formatter is medium agnostic: the interface should
  	be able to cope with audio as well as with visible data.

	Formatting could be straightforward, when render items are simply formatted
	into something readable by the client, or complex, when for instance one needs
	to output some questionnaire as an XForms instance.
