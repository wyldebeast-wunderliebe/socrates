    This package holds the Socrates core concepts. The package is
    structured with XForms in mind, and as a package is like
    org.w3c.dom: the package specifies only interfaces, needed by the
    Socrates engine.

    At the core of Socrates lie the concepts of Model and Instance:
    the Instance holds all data items, or Nodes, the Model holds all
    logic concerning the data items, like type constraints, relevance
    rules, requiredness rules, etc., wrapped in ItemProperties.

    The last core concept provided is the Submission interface. This
    is needed to tell where data is to be stored.

    As a convenience, the Questionnaire interface is provided. This interface
    provides a wrapper specification for runnable instances of
    Model/Instance/Rendering combinations. However, feel free to do it
    your own way...
