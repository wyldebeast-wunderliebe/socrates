	This API holds the Socrates Data concepts, like the Instance, Node (see XForms
	definition), and DataType for assigning types to data elements.
	The Instance is a container of Node objects, that are both ordered sequentially
	and hierarchically. In general, the Instance implementation is expected to
	enable questioning of nodes in an XPath kind of way, so that single nodes, but
	also groups can be selected.

	DataType is implemented as fly-weight, with the DataType interface defining a
	stateless possibility to 'eval' an object against a type. The type is defined
	in terms of restrictions and transformations. Usually, first all transformations
	should be executed, than the restriction checked.

  	The LexicalTransformation interface is used to define transformations to the
  	lexical space of a Questionnaire, that is, the representation of a value for
  	human consumption.
